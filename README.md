# COVID 19 Financial Aid Calculator - Switzerland
**A tool to help companies and entrepreneurs to calculate the aid they can get during the COVID 19 crisis**

During the COVID 19 pandemic crisis, a lot of firms, small or big, have to stop their economic activity which can create huge financial problems for them. There are measures put in place by the swiss government, cantons and municipalities to ensure that these firms have the financial help that they deserve to but the problem is the mass of information from a lot of different sources that are difficult to filter for entrepreneurs and firms.

To solve this problem, we developed the COVID 19 Financial Aid Calculator which, from a few informations about a firm or an entrepreneur, can calculate the aid that the firm or the independant can ask the governement. The calculator then gives ressources to the claimant to actually get this help from the canton or government.
