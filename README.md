# COVID 19 Financial Aid Calculator - Switzerland
**A tool to help companies and entrepreneurs to calculate the aid they can get during the COVID 19 crisis**

During the COVID 19 pandemic crisis, a lot of firms, small or big, have to stop their economic activity which can create huge financial problems for them. There are measures put in place by the swiss government, cantons and municipalities to ensure that these firms have the financial help that they deserve to but the problem is that the mass of information from a lot of different sources is difficult to filter for entrepreneurs and companies.

To solve this problem, we developed the COVID 19 Financial Aid Calculator or CovidAid which, from a few informations about a firm or an entrepreneur, can calculate the aid that the firm or the independant can ask the governement. The calculator then gives ressources to the claimant to actually get this help from the canton or government like the links to the specific informations to his case or the forms to submit in order to get the financial aid so needed.

The advantage to have such a calculator is that it gives a good approximation while being simple enough so that it doesn't take too much time to use it. An employer or an entrepreneur can have a quick overview of the help they can get from the government and then decide if it is worth it to apply for this financial aid.

## Calculator

The calculator is made to give a **good approximation** to the employer and also to be as **low time-consuming** as possible because the actual application for a loan or subsidies is stressful enough. In order to do that, the calculator needs the average monthly payroll, the revenue of the firm, the number of employees, the type of firm and also some more informations if the employer has the independant status.

Depending on the zipcode, the algorithm will also display specific informations for the canton or the city the employer is in.
